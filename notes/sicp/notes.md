Notes from the videos
=====================

1. The process of simplification by hiding the details and thus increasing the "distance from reality" is called abstraction. 
	a. Abstraction helps one understand complex things. 
	b. How to find the right kind of abstraction?
		1. Ask "What do I want to communicate and to whom?"
		2. Ask "What do the audience already understand?"
		3. Ask "What is the means available to me to communicate?"
	c. Abstraction is the key to software design
		1. First take apart things in the complex system and look at them individually. Implement the individual parts first and then compose them.

1. The more types of abstraction a programming language supports, the better we can use it. Imagine a programming language like java where there is(was) no abstraction to be able to deal with functions as arguments.

1. Substitution model is an abstraction that helps us get closer to how a program is executed on the system.

1. Recursion and Iteration are two ways to solve certain kinds of problems
	a. In recursion the state in the program at any point in time is not explicit. But in iteration, it is.
	b. Recursion is a thinking tool, an abstraction, that enables us to solve complex problems by recursively simplifying the complex problem.
	c. In many cases, iteration is more difficult to understand then recursion but the former might run better on machines.

1. To become a good programmer, one needs to build an intuition of how the program we write actually works on the computer and also in the minds of the reader.
